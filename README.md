# Milestone 1 Project: Band Website

The client, a 60s rock band, has requested a website creating to promote their band. The primary purpose of this is for their fans, past and future, to view media (photos, audio, and videos) of the band's past and future works, and information about the band (including links to social media).

The secondary purpose of this website will be to use it to promote the band to potential clients to hire them for events and gigs.
 
## UX
 
#### User stories
There are two main user types: fans and clients.
* Fans will want to visit the site for information on the band, view photos, listen to music clips, and watch videos.
* Clients will want all of the above, plus the ability to contact the band to enquire about booking them for events.

1. As a fan/client, I want to visit an About Section, so I can learn about the band.
2. As a fan/client, I want to visit a page of the band's music, so I can listen/watch previous performances.
3. As a fan/client, I want to visit a page with photos of the band, so I can look at photos of the band/previous performances.
4. As a fan/client, I want to see a list of their future events, so I can see when they are playing / are availible.
5. As a client, I want to be able to contact the band, so I can discuss booking them.

#### Pages
The site will consist of the following pages:
* About - information about the band and band members
* Discography - info of the band's albums
    * ? Thumbnails of album cover art which link to individual pages for each album?
        * ? Each album page has info (song list, release date) and a sample song(s)
* Videos - videos of the band
* Booking - contact page advertising what sort of venues and gigs the band plays at and contact link/form for clients to book them.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Contact form is currently a dummy (requires javascript or alternative)
- A merchandising page. Most bands have some form of online shop to sell albums and band merch. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
